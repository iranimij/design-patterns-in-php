# Strategy pattern definition

`__The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, Encapsulates each one and
makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.__
`

This pattern is kind of about the below rules:

`_Favor composition over inheritance._`

We change some functions that vary (Fly and Quack), encapsulate them and use them with composition.
