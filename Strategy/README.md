# Strategy pattern definition

`The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, Encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.`

This pattern is kind of about the below rules:

`Favor composition over inheritance.`

We change some functions that vary (Fly and Quack), encapsulate them and use them with composition.
